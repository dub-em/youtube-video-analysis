    "Punctuated Subtitle": "I asked Chad GPT, \"If the French loved Christmas?\" and he replied, \"Yes, the French generally like Christmas. It is a very popular party in France, as in many countries of the world. But I think that this answer deserves to be nuanced. Personally, I am not a big Christmas fan, and the holidays at the end of the year. So, I went to ask other people how they felt as the year ends and the Christmas period approaches. It's a period that you like or not. Well, then, me, really not. I said that 10 minutes ago, but really, I like not at all. I just can't wait to pass this period. I don't celebrate Christmas at all. You don't celebrate Christmas? No, that inspires you nothing, not at all. No, but I actively occupy because I owe it to my children and grandchildren. Then, I like.\" I think I'm growing. We like a little less \"hi hi hi.\" Welcome to a new episode of French Mornings. If you learn French, you are at the right place. I am Elisa.

Today, we are talking about Christmas and end-of-year celebrations. That's why I have taken out the jacket of circumstances, and we go see why the French, finally, some like me, don't like them. End-of-year celebrations, then. Set up well, activate the subtitles if you need it, and it is left before I start this video. I remind you that you can download the free PDF of the video with vocabulary and expressions useful used in this video. There is even a. Little quiz: At the end, you will find in the description. But let's go back to our sheep, which is an expression that you will find in the PDF too. That means back to the main subject. I am natalophobic, but what does that mean? It's Natalophobia, literally the phobia of Christmas. It is considered a disorder, anxious. It designates both anxiety, the feeling of discomfort, of depression, or even the sadness that we can feel as the end approaches of the year. I would say that I don't like Christmas exactly, but let's say that the more the end-of-year celebrations approach, the more I feel stressed by the pressure that this event brings to my daily life. And there are three things that particularly disturb me: the pressure to make gifts. That says Christmas, says gift. I love to make gifts for birthdays or even for the end of year celebrations, but with Christmas arrives additional stress, a an avalanche of gifts to be expected in one record time. It puts a lot of pressure, and with that, we land 1000 questions: do you really need to buy a gift for this tent that we has not seen for 1000 years? Are we offer gifts to distant cousins that we see once a year? It is really a puzzle. In my case, we go say that I offer gifts at Christmas. Since I started working, that is to say for about 10 years, and for all these years, it has been frankly very difficult to stay creative. How to surprise when we have already offered tons of gifts? Not to mention that all that costs an arm. It is very, very expensive. All these gifts represent. A sacred budget, and do not may even appeal to those who will receive them. We realize everything that there is to make all the money. He to spend all the budget that we owe, putting behind. That's why, personally, I start from the month from August to make the jackets. Ah, it's...ph! I think that we are a little knocked out from mid-November by the advertisements and incentive to consume. At immediately buy the gifts, but well, it's part of the game. I think about advertising or we should rather offer gifts and be less in we receive less than before. The organization logistics. The end of year celebrations. It is also quite a logistics, quite stressful to meet with family. In my case, I live in Bordeaux and each year is imperial for the holidays. I must fir. St. Go down to my parents in the South-east by train or by car, but the trip does not stop there. Since this year, we are invited to the mountains at friends, so we will have to go to the Alps and then return to Bordeaux, everything that in a very limited period of time. And it was like that almost all my life, since you may know, my parents moved to the southeast when I was 10 years old. So, I spent some years going back and forth between the north and the south by car. In the middle, chat, dog, gifts, and this locked up for 8 hours to do the round trip every time. Today, it's even more or less the same. It is always very long, tragedies at Christmas. And honestly, it's pretty tiring, yeah. The negative side is rather all these family meetings and all the fa. Mily arriving with people that we may not always want to see. That it is good to see them once per year, and that's enough. After, it's true that it is command the race is tiring. So, I would say that there are positive sides and negative sides there also. And finally, what bothers me or this, that I don't like to approach holidays, is nostalgia for childhood. Celebrate Christmas when you are an adult. It's very different to celebrate Christmas when we are as a child. It has nothing to do. And finally, I think that's what is the most difficult to live for me in this period. The people with whom we historical is different. We have been able to sometimes moving away from certain members of the family or losing others. And these moments are always a li. Little soft, I am sea, and if we add stress to that, Gifts Organization Logistics. The winter cold, it makes a period. Quite complicated today. It's a little more mixed in the sense that there may be less opportunity to make meals like when you were little. \u00f9ou, it may be less magical. So, if you are like me, know that you are not alone. I think it's the feeling of many other people also. Thank you all for having watched this video.
